# A Nuxt Portfolio with Sanity

This project is a personal portfolio developed with Nuxt with the headless CMS Sanity. It is my first Nuxt app with Sanity. As such, I consider this project more of a Nuxt/Sanity playground.

I try to regularly update the README file, to keep the documentation as up to date as possible. Also, to make organisation a bit more managable, the documentation will primarily focus on thematic scopes and most relevant updates. This will ensure hopefully a clean and readable documentation.

With that, it goes without saying this is a WIP and I welcome comments, suggestions and critiques.

## Requirements

1. An barebones Nuxt SPA with the headless CMS Sanity.
2. Has Pages and Layouts defined for various pages of the app.
3. Has Vue components for repeatable codes in the app, such as nav bar.
4. Has a homepage with a Hero section, a selected gallery of (blog)posts, a 'contact me' section, and a footer.
5. Has an About me page.
6. Has a Portfolio page powered by Sanity.
7. Images and texts are responsive and available in light and dark colour profiles.
8. The app follows the mobile-first principle of development.
